test_all.sh is the scripts that contains
all of the tests that should be fulfilled
when a modification is pushed.

Scripts whose names are *.draft.sh indicate
the specifications that are not implemented.
When one of them is implemented, the draft
test should be erased and the test in the draft
should be moved to the tests in test_all.sh.
